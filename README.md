# aws-study-quiz
A handy way to study for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam.  This data set can be dropped into a free tool like Quizlet which will let you learn and practice on your phone or in your browser.

The data in aws-study-cards is two colums of tab separated values.  (I've found that to be the cleanest way to import into Quizlet).  The first column is the "answer" and the second column is the "question" or statement to evaluate.

My hope is to create a fun way to study for the above mentioned exam.
Please enjoy and contribute!!
