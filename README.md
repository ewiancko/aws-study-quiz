# aws-study-quiz
A handy way to study for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam.  These data sets can be dropped into a free tool like Quizlet which will let you learn and practice on your phone or in your browser.

There are two files:
* aws-storage-study-cards - focused on S3 and the other AWS storage capabilities
* aws-non-storage-study-cards - focused on everything else about AWS

The data is in two colums of comma separated values.  A double-quote text delimiter is included when the text contains a comma.  The first column is the "answer" and the second column is the "question" or statement to evaluate.

My hope is to create a fun way to study for the above mentioned exam.
Please enjoy and feel free to contribute to the repo.

Cheers,
