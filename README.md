# aws-study-quiz
A handy way to study for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam.  This data set can be dropped into a free tool like Quizlet which will let you learn and practice on your phone or in your browser.

The data in aws-study-cards is two colums of comma separated values with double-quote text delimiter.  The first column is the "answer" and the second column is the "question" or statement to evaluate.

For import into Quizlet or other flashcard tool, it may be best to eliminate the double-quotes first.  (Find/replace works well for this in a text editor.)

My hope is to create a fun way to study for the above mentioned exam.
Please enjoy and contribute!!
